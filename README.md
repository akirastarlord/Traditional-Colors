# Project Traditional Colors

<h3>README for Dominic</h3>

1. The GitHub link has changed from the one in my milestone 1 and 2 submissions, as I have moved my project to this new repo. So please refer to the above link for the most up-to-date work.

2. You may need to sign in (through Google) to get the most out of signed-in user experience.

3. The functionalities I have implemented and included in the submission so far should completely work without any bugs or unexpected behaviors. If you run into unexpected behaviors or am confused about code structures, data structures, or models, please let me know.

4. I'll try to get a video recorded by Dec. 6th noon, as you said it is appreciated for projects which included Firebase. However, I may not be able to complete it, because I still have another project as well as another assignment due on the same day. I hope my grade won't be affected if I don't end up not being able to do recording.

Thank you for your interest for my project, and if you feel the demo I did today in class was not comprehensive enough for you to get to know the project and/or for grading, please also let me know.


<h3>README is still under contruction</h3>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

Colors are an extremely important part of our lives — we see them every day, use them in every of our creations, and rely on them in describing and explaining pretty much any of the objects & things around us. However, colors are not just red, blue, green…… There are many other colors, each with a name you probably have never heard of, that are born from interesting ancient histories and potentially lie beyond your original understanding of them. Our product (app), therefore, takes the ambition of changing your perceptions on colors by sharing with you the beautiful stories behind these traditional colors, and helping you create more values out of them.

<h3>A quick demo of the App</h3>

Main scene, where a collection of over 800 traditional Japanese, Chinese and European colors is presented (still updating).
